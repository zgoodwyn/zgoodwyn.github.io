					<p>Orcish Empire is a fantasy city-building game that I am actively working on. 
					It is being made in Unity and uses the C# programming language.  At this point in time, 
					orcs are able to move around the map, become employed at buildings, and 
					transport goods from one building to another.  There is also a water system 
					where water can be transported over aqueducts from reservoirs filled with water to empty 
					reservoirs.  An entertainment system also exists where employed orcs at buildings such as 
					the arena can supply entertainment to nearby houses.</p>

				<h2>Gallipoli Model</h2>

				<div class="information">
					<p>The Gallipoli peninsula was the location of a battle in World War 1 which involved
					British, ANZAC (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps), and Turkish forces.
					Gallipoli is a prime example where British and ANZAC command
					structure broke down.  Using this background, the multidisciplinary
					team of people from Engineering, International Affairs, and Computational Media wanted
					to look into the potential effects of giving troops more autonomy in a battle.
					I primarily worked on coding the model
					while my teammates worked on figuring out what parts of the battle needed to be
					represented.  We worked together to figure out how the different elements of the
					battle would be represented in the model.</p>
					<p>
					The video shown here depicts the best case scenario we found for giving troops
					more autonomy.  The red dots on the screen are the ANZAC forces, the blue dots are
					the British forces, and the green dots are the Turkish forces.  The black triangles
					are objectives the ANZAC and British are trying to reach.  The Turkish troops are trying
					to force the ANZAC and British off of the peninsula.

					<p>This game is a top-down shooter which requires the player to destroy the enemy base before his/her own base is destroyed.
					The enemies will adapt after each round in an attempt to counter the player's strategy.  This game was
					created alongside one other person for a project in my Game AI class.  The game was coded in Python
					using Pygame.  I coded the procedural obstacle placement, enemy movements, waypoints, and navigation mesh.</p>

				<div class="information">
					<p>The particle system displays the use of 3D collision detection as well as the creation 
					and manipulation of Bezier splines.  Collision detection can be seen whenever spheres turn 
					red or blue.  Red signifies a collision is currently happening while blue signifies a 
					collision has been resolved.  This system was created with Processing and was coded in Java.</p>

				<div class="information">
					<p>Full Moon is a 2D platformer I created for my Media Device Architecture
					class.  The player controls a werewolf and must escape the dungeon.  Along
					the way, the player will encounter obstacles he/she must fight or jump over to
					advance in the levels.  The game is coded in C and uses a Gameboy emulator to run.
					I fully coded Full Moon from the ground up.</p>
